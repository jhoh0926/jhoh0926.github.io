<span style="font-size:120%">Sea level rise due to anthropogenic warming threatens coastal environments and human societies, but its regional reversibility under successful climate mitigation efforts remains unclear. Here, we investigate sea level fluctuations in the Subpolar North Atlantic using idealized atmospheric carbon dioxide ramp-up and -down experiments. <span style="color: DodgerBlue">__During the ramp-up period, the Subpolar North Atlantic experiences a faster sea level rise than the global mean, followed by a more rapid sea level decline over several decades with decreasing carbon dioxide. These rapid sea level fluctuations are mainly driven by the response of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation to carbon dioxide forcing.__</span> The enhanced meridional salinity transport triggered by the rapid recovery of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation plays a crucial role in the regional sea level decline. Our study highlights the potential for pronounced sea level changes in the Subpolar North Atlantic and surrounding coastal areas under climate mitigation scenarios.</span>
