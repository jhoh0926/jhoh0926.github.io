<span style="font-size:120%">Growing attention to decarbonization to limit global warming raises an important question of whether climate mitigation efforts could effectively prevent a potential collapse of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), a major tipping element in the climate system. Using CO2 stabilization simulation with the Community Earth System Model version 1, <span style="color: DodgerBlue">__we show a marked ensemble divergence in AMOC evolution under identical or comparable CO2 forcing, towards either recovery or a multi-century collapsed state. This divergence arises from the accumulation of stochastic noise near the AMOC stability threshold, characterized by persistent high-pressure anomalies over the subpolar North Atlantic.__</span> In other words, internal atmospheric variability can push the AMOC across its stability threshold and trigger collapse, aided by the basin-wide salt-advection feedback. <span style="color: DodgerBlue">__A modest delay in implementing mitigation further increases the likelihood of crossing this threshold, amplifying the risk of collapse.__</span> This study underscores high uncertainties in future climate projections in response to climate mitigation efforts and highlights the urgent need for strong and immediate international actions.</span>
