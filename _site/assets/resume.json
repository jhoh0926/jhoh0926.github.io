I specialize in __<U>integrating Earth system models</U>__ to explore these phenomena. I have conducted several large-ensemble climate simulations using both CESM1 and 2 model. I'm recently focusing on the __<U>tipping point of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC)</U>__. <br> In my free time, I enjoy not only research but also good drinks, experiencing great nature, going to the gym, and snowboarding.
